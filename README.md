# AllianceLogo
Temporary repository for the creation of the BAMM Alliance Logo

Contributions are only allowed as PNG (.png) for layers and final results.. and Project Files only in FREE software formats, like Paint.NET (.pdn), GIMP (.xcf) or Inkscape (.svg) if you prefer vector.

Each suggestion should be in it's own folder, containing project file (1024x1024 GIMP/Paint.NET Project + .png, or .svn + png) and 512x512, 128x128 and 64x64 downscale versions (.png). Ideally also an example folder with the images injected into zKillboard to have an idea how they look in very small sizes.
