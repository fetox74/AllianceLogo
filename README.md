# AllianceLogo
Temporary repository for the creation of the BAMM Alliance Logo

Contributions are only allowed as PNG (.png) for layers and Paint.NET (.pdn) or GIMP (.xcf)

Each suggestion should be in it's own folder, containing a 1024x1024 (GIMP/Paint.NET Project + .png) and 512x512, 128x128 and 64x64 downscale versions (.png). Ideally an example folder with the images injected into zKillboard to have an idea how they look in very small sizes.
